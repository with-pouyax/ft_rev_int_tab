# ft_rev_int_tab

This repository houses the `ft_rev_int_tab` function, an efficient algorithm for reversing the order of elements within an integer array. This function demonstrates a fundamental operation in data manipulation and array handling in C programming.

## Description

The `ft_rev_int_tab` function takes two parameters: a pointer to an integer array (`tab`) and the size of the array (`size`). It reverses the array in place, swapping elements from the beginning with those at the end, progressing towards the center of the array. This in-place reversal is a common algorithmic challenge and is implemented here without the need for additional memory allocation.
